## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the foundational training on Network Security Basics. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of core network security concepts, including common threat vectors and the fundamental controls used to defend against them.

This document serves as a summary and reference guide for task 1 section 1 of the tasks assigned me as a cybersecurity intern at Redynox.

## 2. Topics Covered

The submission is organized into two main summaries:

1.  Network Threats: A detailed breakdown of various types of malicious software that threaten network integrity, availability, and confidentiality.
2.  Security Controls: An overview of the primary mechanisms and strategies used to protect network assets and data from the identified threats.

### 2.1 Summary of Key Network Threats
The following common threat types were analyzed:
*   Viruses: Malicious code that requires user interaction to execute and spread.
*   Worms: Self-replicating malware that propagates across networks autonomously.
*   Trojans: Malware disguised as legitimate software to create backdoors.
*   Phishing Attacks: Social engineering techniques designed to steal credentials.
*   Additional threats reviewed: Ransomware, Spyware, DDoS, and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

### 2.2 Summary of Basic Security Concepts
The following fundamental security controls were explored:
*   Firewalls: Network security devices that monitor and filter traffic based on security rules. (Stateful, Stateless, NGFW)
*   Encryption: The process of encoding data to ensure confidentiality and integrity. (Symmetric vs. Asymmetric)
*   Secure Network Configurations: The practice of hardening networks through principles like:
    *   Least Privilege
    *   Network Segmentation
    *   Disabling Unnecessary Services

## 3. Purpose and Learning Objectives

This project was completed to:
*   Solidify my understanding of the current cyber threat landscape.
*   Articulate the function and importance of foundational security controls.
*   Prepare for further practical training and responsibilities within the Redynox security team.
*   Provide a clear, concise reference document for other team members.
